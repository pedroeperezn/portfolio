                  <p>My name is Pedro E. Perez. I am a software developer, audio/music enthusiast, and video game fanatic!</p>

                  <h2>My Life</h2>
                  <p>I was born in Mexico City. Since I was very young, I showed a particular interest in music, technology and video games. These interest
                    became passions, which eventually lead me to study Audio Engineering in one of Mexico's top Universities.</p>

                <div class="container-xl col-8">
                  <h2>Academic Record</h2>
                  <p>I studied Audio Engineering in the "Tecnologico de Monterrey", State of Mexico Campus. I was president of the Audio Engineering
                    alumni association from 2018 to 2019 and graduated Cum Laude as best GPA of his class in 2020.</p>
                  <p>After graduation, I started working on the music and audio industry, while in my spare time studied Software Development
                    through online courses. I completed the Python for Everyone specialization in Coursera (by the University of Michigan) and
                    also completed other courses such as Intro to Web Development by the University of Duke, CS50 by the University of Hardvard
                    and currently I'm still enrolled on online courses. 
                  </p>
                  <p>In order to formalize my programming learning experience, I enrolled in the "Programming for Games, Web and Mobile" program at the Vancouver Film School, where
                    I worked in the projects "Where is my mind" and "Everything Must Go!".
